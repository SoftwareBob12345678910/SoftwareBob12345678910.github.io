# Database Systems Fundamentals

## Needs of database systems.

The first lesson introduced about fundamentals concepts of data,database and database management systems.In that I have learned that data is just collection of facts,while database is an organized collection of data and database management system is a set of programs to access the data efficiently.

The other thing we have learned was the disadvantage of file processing system.Earlier when database systems was not introduced,industries relied on files processing system causing data rebundancy,inconsistency,difficulty in accessing data,data isolation,integrity problems and atomicity problems.

After database systems was introduced these problems were solved ensuring data consistency,security and ease of access.Due to that it was helpful to industries like banking,healthcare and government services.
I also learned about the origin or history of database systems.


## Data models and Database design.

In second lesson I was introduced to data models where i learned that the data model is classified into four categories which are:
- Entity-relationship model
- Semi-structured data model
- Object based data model
- Relational model

From that i found out that relational model is the most widely used model with SQL as its primary tool for interacting with databases.

I also learned about the problems caused by early DBMS which was difficult to build and maintain,tight coupling  between logical and physical layers and programmers had to define queries before deploying the database. Later Edgar F. Codd a mathematician has invented relational model that separated the logical and physical layers.

The concept of data abstraction was also new to me, where database are designed as different levels.
- Physical level(how data is stored)
- Logical level(what data is stored and how it relates)
- View level(how data is presented to users)

Also learned about the SQL(Structured Query Language) which is a tool where it allows users to:
- create tables and define structures(DDL)
- manipulate data(insert,update,deletes) using(DML)
- Retrieve data using queries(Select Statement)

I have been also introduced to database engines where it handles all operations inside a database.It has three main parts:
- Storage manager:Manages data storage
- Query processor:Processes SQL commands
- Transaction Manager:Ensures data integrity during multiple user transaction

Popular database engines are MySQL,PostgresSQL and Maria DB.

We also learned about the database system architecture:

## Flipped Class
### Database user and DatabaseAministrator

In flipped class we have learned about database user and database administrator.Database user is define as a person who interacts with data daily,updating,reading and modifying the given data.
There are many types of database users which are:
- Database administrator(DBA)
- Naive/Parametric End Users
- A system analyst
- Sophisticated users
- Database designers
- Application Programmers
- Casual users
- Specialized users

The second thing that I learned is about database administrator. Database administrator is a IT professional who is incharge of creating and maintaining a secure database.

Roles of DBA is:
- Managing the relationship with the database vendors and service providers
- Conducting regular audits of the database systems
- Providing support to the staffs
- Developing and implementing policies and maintaining them
- Identifying and trouble shooting database issues
- creating and maintaining data dictionaries
- Ensuring that database are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieved

Functions of DBA:
The main functions of DBA is
- Database design
- Database security

## Conclusion

After learning about database systems, I realized the importance of database system in our life. How it has impact on our daily lives.I also understood why companies and industries invest in database administrator to maintain and optimize database.Their role is critical in keeping the data accurate, secure and accessible for business operations.
